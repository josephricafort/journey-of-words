é = close e
è = open e
ó = close o
ò = close o
Word-final schwa is stressed and more tense, similar to central [3], though it
doesn't contrast with schwa (which is found elsewhere). Some dialects preserve
final [a] while most raise and centralis to [E], and others lower and back it to
open-o (like Javanese). Also, in some dialects there is harmony of earlier [a]
with the final vowel. So 'eye' is variably: mata ~ matE ~ mEtE ~ mEt'o ~ m'ot'o.
This level of variation is not included, but only the majority form.
There is also dialect variation between final l and final n, so some speakers
have 'to sit' as t'ok'on, but most have t'ok'ol.","Typed By: Peter Austin  Checked By:","Total Data: 267","Number of Retentions: Proto Malayo-Polynesian:113","Number of Loans: 9","Austronesian:Malayo-Polynesian:Bali-Sasak-Sumbawa:Sasak-Sumbawa",NA,"http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=sas"

""REMARKS on the Otaheitean Language.
The language is very soft, having a great number of vowels, diphthongs, and triphthongs. Every word, almost, begins with a vowel, which they most commonly drop.
It is also very metaphorical, as I have observed in many instances; as Matapoa, a person blind of an eye, which literally is Night-eye. Mataavai, the name of the bay we anchored in, literally signifies Watery-eye; which appellation is not unapt from the great quantity of rain which falls in the bay. Tehaia, a woman's name, who being lost when a child, her friends went about, crying Tehai? which means, Where is she? The natives could not repeat, after us, the sounds of the letters, Q, X, and Z, without great difficulty; G, K, and S, they could not pronounce at all.  Many of the names of the people of our ship having the G, K, or S, in them, they could not approach nearer the sound of them than as follows:
Toote, for Cook.
Matà for Monkhouse.

Tate  Clark
Treene  Green
Poline  Spoving
Hite  Hicks
Taibe  Stainsby
Towara  Gore
Patine  Parkinson
""They have various sounds peculiar to themselves, which none of us could Imitate; some of them they pronounced like B and L mingled together; others between B and P, and T and D. Some like Bh, Lh, and Dh. When they mean to speak of a thing somewhat small, they often double the word, as Oorè oorè, a smallish nail. They also double the word for the superlative, as teá teá, very white. Mai, when placed after a verb, signifies that the action was done to you. 
Mai, when added to an adverb, signifies several things, as Mai Maroo, somewhat soft, or inclining to be soft. They have a whoop, when they call after any person, which they pronounce like Ahu! raising their voice very high at the last syllable.""","Typed By: Richard Parker  Checked By:","Total Data: 125","Number of Retentions: Proto Malayo-Polynesian:35","Proto-Oceanic:43Number of Loans: 0","Austronesian:Malayo-Polynesian:Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian:Eastern Malayo-Polynesian:Oceanic:Central-Eastern Oceanic:Remote Oceanic:Central Pacific:East Fijian-Polynesian:Polynesian:Nuclear:East:Central:Tahitic","http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_tah","http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=tah"

Titled ""A Multilateral Look at Greater Austric"" (2006) and ""The 'Greater Austric' Hypothesis"" from ""Linguistic Fossils: Studies in Historical Linguistics and Paleolinguistics"" (2010). Bengtson's articles seek to find cognates from a variety of languages from different Asiatic language families, including Ainu, Austroasiatic (= Munda - Mon-Khmer), Austronesian, Daic (= Tai-Kadai), Hmong-Mien (Miao-Yao), Nihali.  These families are shown to form one, huge hypothetical macro-family called ""Austric."" Batchelor's work is called the ""An Ainu-English-Japanese Dictionary"" (1905).
The Ainu language (spoken by the indigenous Ainu people of Hokkaido, Japan,Kuril Islands, Sakhalin Island, and the Kamchatka peninsula) is shown to have several likely cognates that would place it within Greater Austric, if not Austronesian.

However, the presence of a number of homonyms in the list, some of them loans from the Papuan language One (e.g. pelen 'dog') suggests that at some point either data from different Arop hamlets have been mixed (on this see Laycock in OL 12:245278) or that some items from Ross's Malol list have been included in the file from which the data here were extracted.

Sources:
Those data available in the book of RIVIERRE & al. are based on three major sources : 
- Maurice LEENHARDT's questionnaire reworked by André-Georges HAUDRICOURT; this questionnaire has been used in the village of Oundjo (1959) and Népou (1963)
- Jean-Claude RIVIERRE questionnaire used in Népou (1994)
- The results revision of the previous RIVIERRE's questionnaire by J-C. RIVERRE himself and Sabine EHRHART between 1995 and 1999 in the villages of Népou and Oundjo.
Methodology:
The book of RIVIERRE & al. Contains two dictionnairies.
The first one translates the bwatoo lexical items in french and provides more semantic features.
The second one translates the french lexical items in bwatoo, and provides only a translation without providing any additionnal information on the semantic features. 
The second dictionnary has been used first. When there is more than one term found in bwatoo for one lexical entry in french, the first dictionnary and the developped semantic features it provides has been used to reduce as much as possible the variation and to keep the more relevant term.
Borrowings and selected data:
The lexical items selected here are coming from Jean-Claude RIVIERRE and al.
The items borrowed to other languages have not been included. For the most part, borrowings have been listed by the authors. However, the words coming from the french language have not been subject to such a list. They have been excluded by David PIEKUT when possible.","Several lexical items refer to the same notion.

Those data available in the book of RIVIERRE & al. are based on three major sources:
- Maurice LEENHARDT's questionnaire reworked by André-Georges HAUDRICOURT; this questionnaire has been used in the village of Oundjo (1959) and Népou (1963)
- Jean-Claude RIVIERRE questionnaire used in Nepou (1994)
- The results revision of the previous RIVIERRE's questionnaire by J-C. RIVERRE himself and Sabine EHRHART between 1995 and 1999 in the villages of Népou and Oundjo.
Methodology:
The book of RIVIERRE & al. Contains two dictionaries. The first one translates
the Bwatoo lexical items in french and provides more semantic features. Along
with the translation in french, this dictionary provide a translation for
Haeke and Haveke as well. The second one translates the french lexical items
in Bwatoo, and provides only a translation without providing any additional
information on the semantic features. The second dictionary has been used
first to find the targeted word in Bwatoo, and then, from the Bwatoo word, the
first dictionary has been used to find the translation in Haeke and Haveke.
When there is more than one term found in Bwatoo for one lexical entry in
french, the first dictionary and the developed semantic features it provides
has been used to reduce as much as possible the variation and to keep the more
relevant term","Several lexical items refer to the same notion. As the

NOTE 1 (Source) : The data presented here comes from a non-published work of Jim HOLLYMAN and Maurice MWÊAU. This work contains a sketch of  Caac grammar (phonology, morpholy and syntax), a few tales in Caac, as well as a bilingual dictionnary (Caac-French / French-Caac).
In terms of documentation and description, this work takes over from Maurice LEENHARDT's documentation and linguistics description attempt during the beginning of the 20th century.
NOTE 2 (Methodology) : The work of Jim Hollyman & al. provides two dictionnaries.
The first one translates the Caac lexical items in French and provides precise semantic features.
The second one translates the French lexical items in Caac, and provides only a translation without providing any additionnal information on the semantic features. 
The second dictionnary has been used first. When there is more than one term found in Caac for one lexical entry in french, the first dictionnary and the developped semantic features it provides has been used to reduce as much as possible the variation and to keep the more relevant term (i.e. the more general one which semantic features fit the ones of the English word).
NOTE 3 (Borrowings) : The authors do not provide a list of borrowed word from another language. The borrowing is mentionned case by case. When possible, they have been removed from the data entry and a note signals it.","This dictionnary include a sketch of Caac grammar, but does not provide any numerals description.

It is presented in the book Dictionnaire Xârâcùù-Français (Nouvelle-Calédonie), Nouméa : Les Editions Populaires, 288 pp.
It provides a phonological, greographical, and sociolinguistical introduction to the Xârâcùù, language spoken in the Kouaoua-Canala-Thio areas (located on the east cost of the New Caledonia Main Land ('Grande-Terre'). 
This book, intended to speakers usage, provides two lexicons, one in xârâcùù-french, and one in french-xârâcùù. 
Methodology used here to enter the lexical data : 
- The synonymy has been reduced by going through both lexicons.
- When two words in Xârâcùù are presented with a slash (for instance ""xa~nd<U+0268>/xa~nd<U+0264>"", it means that those words are two morphological forms of the same word (generally related to geographical distribution of this word).
- When both simple words and compound words are possible in Xârâcùù to translate a word in the list, we have opted for the simple words.
- When a word is not phonologically autonomous (i.e being a prefix or a suffix), a dash has been put after the word (prefix) or before the word (suffix).
- When a word in the list can not be translated by a single general item in xârâcùù, some semantic specifications for each one of them have been provided in the 'author annotation' column.","Typed By: David VUILLAUME-PIEKUT  Checked By:","Total Data: 250","Number of Retentions: Proto Malayo-Polynesian:0","Proto-Oceanic:0Number of Loans: 0","Austronesian:Malayo-Polynesian:Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian:Eastern Malayo-Polynesian:Oceanic:Central-Eastern Oceanic:Remote Oceanic:New Caledonian:Southern:South:Xaracuu-Xaragure","http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_xar","http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ane"

As we do not know clearly which degree of aperture is more likely to have the nasal vowel - the aperture of [e] or [<U+025B>] -, the words with a [ê] vowel in the source document will transcribed the [e] nasalised and the [<U+025B>] nasalised. The two possible transcriptions will be then signaled with a slash. 
Note that the problem is the same with the two oral vowels [o] and [<U+0254>] ending up in a single naslasiled vowel we could transcribe either [o~] or [<U+0254>~].
